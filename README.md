DoubleSavePDF
=============

## Description

With DoubleSavePDF, whenever I save(both file>save and ctrl+s) a word document, a pdf version is saved in the same folder with the same name but with a different(PDF) extension. And it stays up to date with the most current save.

## Why did you make this?

When I was writing and designing my resume I that I kept making a change, saving the word document, then saving it as PDF and uploading it to various job hunting profiles. It became tedious to repeat for every little change I made to it.

Sometimes when I was emailing my resume, I forgot if I had the latest version in PDF form, so I had to re-open Word and then save it as PDF just to be sure.

In addition, I also wanted to experiment with C# a little bit and learn to use Visual Studio 2012. Overall, not a bad use of 3 hours of time(not including the time it takes to update VS and install plugins, which is a whole another topic...).

## Do I need to use this?

For most people, No. But if you often find yourself inconvenienced with converting word documents to PDF, sure.
